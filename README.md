## How to Use Laravel Sanctum API Authentication:

### Installation and Setup:

1. Start by installing Laravel Sanctum into your Laravel project using Composer:

composer require laravel/sanctum


2. Once installed, configure Sanctum by publishing its configuration file and setting up its migration:

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Laravel\Sanctum\SanctumServiceProvider"

3. Run the migration to create the necessary tables in your database:

php artisan migrate


### Configuration:

1. Configure Laravel Sanctum to work with your authentication guard by specifying the guard name in the Sanctum configuration file (`config/sanctum.php`).

2. Customize the authentication middleware to use Sanctum's authentication guard.

### Usage:

1. Create API routes that need to be protected by authentication using Sanctum's middleware.

2. Generate API tokens for authenticated users by calling Sanctum's `createToken` method:

$token = $user->createToken('token-name')->plainTextToken;


3. Attach the generated token to subsequent API requests made by the authenticated user.

4. Verify the token in your API controllers using Sanctum's `auth` middleware.

### Common Scenarios and Best Practices:

1. Explore common authentication scenarios such as user registration, login, and logout, and implement them securely using Laravel Sanctum.

2. Follow best practices for token management, such as token expiration, token revocation, and refreshing tokens.
